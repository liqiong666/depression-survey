\section{Introduction}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%ÏþÍ®£¨»ù´¡ÖªÊ¶Ç¨ÒÆ£©%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%Depression were the most common mental disorders, which brought great challenge to personal wellbeing and social economy around the world. According to World Health Organization (WHO), people with mental illness are among the main victims of the Covid-19 pandemic, with worldwide cases of depression rising by more than 25\% during the pandemic. Depression is a mental illness that does not directly lead to death, but many depressed people are unable to overcome their psychological barriers and choose to commit suicide. According to statistical surveys, the probability of suicide in depression is around 10-15\%. Given the high prevalence of depression and the risk of suicide, it is becoming increasingly important to find new diagnostic and treatment protocols.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


Depression is one of the most common mental disorders~\cite{world2017depression,bhugra2004globalisation,rao2008understanding}, affecting more than 300 million people worldwide\cite{wang2021social}.
Depression is characterized by persistent grief, losing interest in things that are usually enjoyed, and the inability to participate in daily activities\cite{peveler2002depression}.
It will also make patients feel poorly and lose their living ability\cite{singh2009loneliness}.
Worse still, patients with severe symptoms have thoughts of self-harm or suicide~\cite{eisenberg2007prevalence,bergfeld2018treatment,hemming2019alexithymia}.
It is estimated that close to 70\% of depressed patients have had suicidal thoughts, and over 50\% have self-harmed\cite{huang2019prevalence}.
In short, the dangers of depression are staggering.

To alleviate the damage caused by depression, a timely and effective diagnosis is essential. However, there are three main challenges in the clinical diagnosis of depression:
(1) Lack of valid and accurate objective indicators. Compared with other physiological diseases, there are no objective and specific biochemical examination indexes, physiological data or medical images to diagnose and quantify depression. And clinicians can only make judgments based on the diagnostic criteria and their own working experience, as well as the clinical manifestations of patients~\cite{faust1988expert}, which may lead to biased diagnostic results due to some patients' uncooperative treatment and deliberate concealment of their true state.
(2) Serious shortage of medical resources. At present, there is a serious shortage of medical professionals and medical resources for the diagnosis and treatment of depression. In particular, in low- and middle-income countries, up to 75\% of patients do not receive timely diagnosis and treatment. In addition, face-to-face psychiatric consultations are time-consuming and inefficient, further exacerbating the shortage of resources for psychiatric treatment~\cite{cheng2022addressing,butryn2017shortage}.
(3) Deficiencies in social awareness. The low level of awareness of depression and the unconscious resistance or avoidance of mental illnesses can cause early depression to be underestimated or neglected, thus missing the best time for treatment, and may lead to the aggravation of the disease and increase the difficulty and complexity of treatment\cite{finch2000perceived,lauber2005recommendations,angermeyer2011biogenetic,pescosolido2013backbone}.

%To alleviate the damage caused by depression, timely and effective diagnosis is essential.
%However, there are four main challenges in the clinical diagnosis of depression:
%(1) Lack of valid and accurate objective indicators. In contrast to other physiological disorders, there are no objective and specific biochemical indicators, physiological signal data, or medical imaging to diagnose and quantify depression. Clinicians can only diagnose depression by interviewing patients, and at the same time, some patients do not cooperate with the diagnosis and deliberately conceal their true state, resulting in biased or misdiagnosed findings.

%However, there are various issues that need to be addressed in the clinical diagnosis of depression.
%On the one hand, compared to other physical diseases, there are no objective and specific biochemical indicators, physiological signal data, or medical imaging for diagnosing and quantifying depression.
%The clinician can only make a diagnosis by interviewing the patient and using assessment scales~\cite{faust1988expert}, which depend on the patient's level of cooperation.
%Nonetheless, social discrimination may make depressed people feel stressed\cite{finch2000perceived,lauber2005recommendations,angermeyer2011biogenetic,pescosolido2013backbone}.
%When face-to-face communication with a doctor or filling in the questionnaire, they may deliberately conceal some facts and that will lead to misdiagnosis.
%On the other hand, there is a severe shortage of professional psychiatrists required for the traditional diagnosis of depression worldwide\cite{cheng2022addressing,butryn2017shortage}, which prevents many patients from being diagnosed and treated promptly.

%The subjective factors of doctors or patients may cause misjudgements, which have an impact on the assessment of depression risk, and the search for objective methods has become the focus of research.
%In response to this circumstance, researchers have carried out studies on the evaluation of depression risk from several angles.
%By comparing the differences in physiological indicators and communication feedback exhibited between depressed and healthy people, they propose a series of machine learning-based methods to assist in depression identification.
%These methods focus on \emph{brain imaging}\cite{schnyer2017evaluating,sato2015machine,ramasubbu2016accuracy,vai2020predicting,wei2021functional},  \emph{electrophysiological signals}\cite{nilsonne2021eeg,shim2019machine,jiang2016predictability,li2016classification,kim2018automatic}, \emph{Audiovisual data}\cite{ma2016depaudionet,zhou2018visually,miao2021automatic},
%\emph{text}\cite{trotzek2018utilizing,park2015manifestation,yang2020big}, and \emph{multi-modal data}\cite{yang2017hybrid}.


%To address the difficulty of clinical diagnosis of depression, in recent years, researchers have proposed massive machine learning approaches based on the premise of comparing physiological indicators differences between depressed and healthy ones~\cite{luo2016big}.
%It not only avoids misdiagnosis or underdiagnosis due to patient non-cooperation to a large extent but also dramatically improves the efficiency of clinical diagnosis, reduces healthcare costs, and alleviates the shortage of healthcare resources.


To address the difficulty of clinical diagnosis of depression, in recent years, researchers have proposed massive machine learning approaches. With the help of machine learning, researchers extract effective features from depression patient data automatically, and then tap the intrinsic connection between depression clinical symptoms and patients' physiological signals, which has become an important direction for auxiliary diagnosis of  depression (ADD) ~\cite{luo2016big}. The following advantages exist for machine learning-based ADD:
(1) High efficiency: through the analysis of physiological signals of depression patients to establish objective diagnostic indicators, the efficiency of clinical diagnosis can be greatly improved by computer technology.
(2) Low interference: the machine learning method is used for automatically ADD, which eliminates the need for deliberate observation by clinicians and reduces the difficulty in depression diagnosis and treatment due to patient non-cooperation.
Despite the rapid evolution in this field, there is still no systematic study to review and discuss existing progress.
To fill this gap, a systematic analysis is carried out recent ancillary diagnosis of depression (ADD) studies about the application of machine learning on various categories of data, and the research process and methods of machine learning in ADD are summarized, and finally, the research directions and challenges in the future are presented.
As shown in Fig~\ref{Taxonomy}, we focus on the progress of the methods and potential research directions in five data contexts: \emph{brain imaging}\cite{schnyer2017evaluating,sato2015machine,ramasubbu2016accuracy,vai2020predicting,wei2021functional},  \emph{electrophysiological signals}\cite{nilsonne2021eeg,shim2019machine,jiang2016predictability,li2016classification,kim2018automatic}, \emph{Audiovisual data}\cite{ma2016depaudionet,zhou2018visually,miao2021automatic},
\emph{text}\cite{trotzek2018utilizing,park2015manifestation,yang2020big}, and \emph{mixed-modal data}\cite{yang2017hybrid}.
These commonly used representation forms of physiological signals are illustrated in Fig~\ref{common signals}
and some rough descriptions of them are as follows:


(1) \emph{Brain imaging:}
%%Brain function, brain structure, and brain metabolism imaging studies are the three main categories for brain imaging studies of depression.
%%%However, there are fewer structural and metabolic brain imaging investigations using depressed patients.
%%However, there are far more studies based on functional brain imaging than on the latter two.
%Brain imaging studies of depression are mainly divided into brain function, brain structure, and brain metabolism imaging studies. However, there are far more studies based on functional brain imaging of depressed patients,
%which mainly focus on dysfunction in the frontal lobe\cite{zhang2018multi,yamamura2016association,huang2017altered}, temporal lobe\cite{rolls2018effective}, amygdala\cite{zhu2018abnormal}, and cingulate gyrus\cite{gbyl2019cortical}.
%Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is currently the main tool for studying functional brain imaging.
Brain imaging refers to the usually non-invasive or minimally invasive techniques that enable imaging the structure or function of the brain~\cite{lenartowicz2017brain}. This is achieved by scanning the subject¡¯s brain with various precision instruments.
Its main data representations are: Functional Nearinfrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS), nuclebar Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), etc. Studies have shown that, to some extent, brain imaging can identify different types of depression depending on the part of the brain affected~\cite{nestler2002neurobiology}.


(2) \emph{Electrophysiological signals:}
Electrophysiological signals are caused by changes in the membrane potential of individual cells~\cite{widmann2015digital}, which are usually recorded by metal electrodes placed on the body surface. The common electrophysiological signals that are of clinical interest are electroencephalography (EEG, tracing brain tissue activities), electrocardiography (ECG, recordings of the cardiac movement), and electrooculogram (EOG, examining the behavior of eyes). They have been used extensively to ADD because of their non-invasive detection and ease of use.
%Electrophysiological signals, which mainly include EEG,
%ECG, EOG, galvanic skin response, and body temperature,
%have been used extensively to diagnose depression because of
%their non-invasive detection and ease of use
% These signals arise from the membrane potential changes of electrically active cells, e.g., neurons in the brain controlling bodily functions, muscle cells enabling motion, pacemaker cells governing heart rhythm, and pancreatic cells responsible for insulin release. The common electrophysiological signals that are of clinical interest are electrocardiography (ECG, recordings of the cardiac movement), electroencephalography (EEG, tracing brain tissue activities), and electromyography (EMG, examining the behavior of muscle fibers or cells).

%Apart from using fMRI to assist in diagnosing depression, electrophysiological signals, especially electroencephalography(EEG), electrocardiography(ECG), electrodermal (EOG), and body temperature, have also received extensive attention\cite{trambaiolli2020resting}.
%EEG signals are most commonly used among them because of their great temporal resolution and sensitivity to minute changes in brain activity \cite{zeng2018eeg}.
%EEG-based methods for depression identification currently mostly use feature extraction with traditional classifier geometry, and some studies have also focused on convolutional neural networks.


%Electrophysiological signals to assist in the diagnosis of depression has also been heavily researched, mainly including electroencephalography, electrocardiography, electrodermal, gastric, ophthalmic, and body temperature. Among these, EEG signals are used most frequently due to their high temporal resolution and sensitivity to slight changes in brain activity [34]. EEG-based methods for depression identification currently mostly use feature extraction with traditional classifier geometry, and some studies have also focused on convolutional neural networks.


(3) \emph{Audiovisual data:}
Audiovisual data, whose forms mainly include facial expressions, speech, and gait, are captured by video and audio recording devices.
Audiovisual data based ADD is the first recognition method proposed by researchers and the most widely used method, which has the advantage of low acquisition cost but can achieve better recognition results.
%The audiovisual data based method was the first method proposed by researchers for ADD and is the most widely used method, with the advantage of low acquisition cost but better recognition results.


%Many researchers have used facial expression, speech, and gait to diagnose depression because depressed patients always exhibit abnormal behavior, such as sluggish facial expressions\cite{dai2012more}, frequent avoidance of eye contact, and speaking in short sentences with a flat tone\cite{kraepelin1921manic}. The model is more accurate based on the ease of obtaining data.

(4) \emph{Text:}
Text is the most direct vehicle for people to express their thoughts and emotions. Especially on social media platforms, people are more inclined to express their true feelings. Therefore, many researchers have examined the differences in textual expression between people with depression and normal ones in the context of social media platforms from a textual perspective~\cite{thomee2011mobile}.


(5) \emph{Mixed-modal data:}  In addition to the use of single physiological or behavioural data to assist in the diagnosis of depression, there have been many studies that have sought to employ multi-modal data for diagnosis  \cite{lalousis2021heterogeneity,meng2021bidirectional,toenders2022predicting}.
Multi-modal data have more features than unimodal data, which can give a more complete picture of the symptomatology of depressed patients.
