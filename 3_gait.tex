%\section{Depression recognition method based on gait}
\subsection{Gait}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Human gait, as a daily movement, occurs in parallel with the development of higher brain structures and functions (prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia and cerebellum) and reflects the integrity of the higher brain systems\cite{sheridan2007role}, thus it is a good indicator of mental status.
Compared to traditional mental illness detection biometrics, such as facial expression, speech and physiological parameters, gait is remotely observable, more difficult to imitate, and requires less cooperation from the subject. These advantages make gait a promising source for depression recognition.

Furthermore, researchers have also studied the gait characteristics of depression patients through motion analysis.
Specifically, Lemake et al. [29] calculated the spatiotemporal gait parameters of patients with major depression disorder and found that the patients show significant reductions in stride length, cycle time, and lower limb support.
Moreover, by using the motion capture system with video cameras, Michalak\cite{michalak2009embodiment} found reduced walking velocity, arm swing, vertical body movement, increased body sway and more slumped posture in patients.
Slumped posture is often observed in depressive individuals during sitting, standing and walking.
Thanks to the development of consumer-grade depth cameras (e.g., Kinect, the data collection
scheme is shown in Fig~\ref{kinect}), human body dynamics can be traced accurately in a three dimensional manner without the assistance of the attached markers or the requirement of a specifically designed environment. The recorded depth and skeleton data have been widely and successfully used in depression recognition.
Therefore, in the current studies of depression recognition, the main work is to learn gait features from the skeleton coordinates recorded by Kinect related with depression and explore feature set for better performance.
In the meantime, traditional machine learning algorithms are employed to classify such as SVM, KNN , RF, etc. However, deep learning methods have made breakthroughs in the research fields of both Computer Vision (CV). Therefore, many studies are shifting from the traditional hand crafted gait features to the framework based on deep learning for gait depression recognition.

%Advances in gait data, image technology, and machine learning technology jointly push the development of gait depression recognition.





\subsubsection{Gait depression recognition based on traditional machine learning}


Currently, Gait depression recognition is still in its infancy, with most approaches focusing on traditional machine learning.
Researchers extracted the spatial-temporal, time-domain and frequency-domain features from the skeleton, input them into machine learning classifiers (such as SVM) for depression recognition.% and analyzed the contribution of different types of features.

As mentioned in previous section, depressed patients have cognitive and psychomotor differences compared to normal
people. In traditional research of gait depression recognition,  hand-crafted features are regularly used together with statistical features. The commonly used gait features are as follows:
(1) Time-Domain Features: Gait time-Domain features include mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of the original data.. Specifically, mean is a measure of the central tendency of the random variable characterized by
that distribution. Standard deviation measures the amount of
dispersion of a dataset. Kurtosis measures outliers present in the probability
distribution.
(2)Frequency-Domain Features.
(3)spatial-temporal Features: Spatiotemporal gait parameters, including gait velocity, stride length, cadence, stance phase, swing phase etc., provide basic data characterizing a subjects gait.

Previous studies showed that gait-related features can predict depression accurately, and Kinect provided objective and easily accessible data. Wang et al.\cite{wang2021detecting} used skeleton data estimated by Kinect devices to
predict depression risk in the dataset of 43 scored-depressed and 52 non-depressed individuals. They combined the time domain information, frequency domain information, and spatial geometric features of gait information. The experimental results show that spatial features help a lot in the evaluation of depression.






%The commonly used gait features are as follows:



Traditional classification or regression algorithms are employed after feature extraction such as SVM, LR, RF , Decision Tree, GMM, KNN, etc.
Li \cite{li2021simple} used Kinect V2 device to record participants kinematic skeleton data of the participant¡¯s 25 body joints, the presented spatial features and low-level features is directly extracted from the record original Kinect-3D coordinates. The scored-depressed and non-depressed individuals can be well classified by computational models which were import processed data directly. The proposed experiment demonstrated four strong machine learning tools: Support Vector Machine, Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.

\subsubsection{Gait depression recognition based
on deep learning}
Due to the successful application in CV and NLP, deep learning is introduced to gait depression recognition.
Compared with traditional methods, no human intervention is needed after the model and parameters are determined.
The essence of deep learning is to learn high-level abstract features automatically by building more hidden layer models to improve the accuracy of classification or score prediction.


There are two ways to employ deep learning in this filed: (1) Build a structure combined skeleton feature set and silhouette features with deep learning method.
The key to the skeleton study is the data quality of joint coordinates, which is easily affected by distance, light and other environments, and the skeleton estimation is not accurate in complex scenes. The difficulty of contour study is the cross-view recognition, and the recognition results vary greatly under different views. Multimodal fusion can improve the recognition accuracy and generalization performance of the model by exploiting the correlation between each modality. (2) Build an end-to-end deep architecture and then push skeleton sequence into deep architecture to let model learn high-level features by itself.



In gait depression recognition , deep speech features through pre-trained deep network have made remarkable
performance and are robust to noise changes.
Shao \cite{shao2021multi}  proposed a multi-modal depression recognition method by combining skeleton data and silhouette data of gait.
Firstly, for skeleton data, the skeleton feature set for depression recognition was proposed, which
included spatiotemporal features and kinematics features. For silhouette data, a CNN model with a new loss function was designed to extract silhouette features. Finally, they merged the silhouette features of the front and side views; then in the decision level, they fused the classification results of skeleton data and silhouette data.




Compared with methods of performing feature extraction and classification separately, an end to end deep architecture pushes raw signal into its model to learn and give results as shown in Figure 2.
End to end deep architecture have advantages like that it does not require scholars to have a priori
knowledge, deep networks can learn better features and give better classification result. However, there are a few issues which limit end-to-end deep architectures, such as large-scale data supporting, over-fitting easily and poor interpretability.
The use of deep learning algorithms to identify depression is now increasingly widely studied, however, there is often a lack of relevant experimental data or difficulty in collecting large amounts of data in the actual research process. With limited data, model performance is often poor and prone to over-fitting, so data size is increasingly becoming one of the bottlenecks limiting further research on automatic depression recognition. In image processing, data enhancement is a commonly used method that can solve the over-fitting problem caused by insufficient data to a certain extent. Data augmentation includes a set of techniques that can augment the size and quality of training datasets, and it has been proved to be effective to improve the performance of the deep learning models[38]. Yang \cite{yang2022data} proposed a skeleton data augmentation method based on Kinect V2 to evaluate the risk of depression. First, Yang proposed five techniques to enhance skeleton data and applied it to depression and emotion datasets. Then, according to mutual information and classification accuracy, the augmentation methods are divided into two categories (non-noise augmentation and noise augmentation). The results showed that this data augmentation method greatly improves the recognition effect of the classifier.





\subsubsection{Performance Comparison}

To shed more light on the performance of gait depression recognition methods, we summarize the performance of the methods tested in Tabel~\ref{tab_gait}.
To perform a fair comparison, the experimental classification accuracy results (\%) are directly derived from the corresponding original papers.
It should be noted that we concentrate on contrasting the performance of various approaches on the same data set.
From the performance comparison in Table~\ref{tab_gait}, several observations can be summarized as:


(1) For traditional gait depression recognition methods, scholars have been working on exploring novel gait features and using traditional machine learning models for classification with increasing accuracy.
Specifically, first, time- and frequency-domain features are more efficient in constructing computational models to identify depression than spatiotemporal features~\cite{wang2021detecting}. It is worth noting that the models built of time- domain features and spatiotemporal and time- domain features have the same performances, which suggests that spatiotemporal features had very few contributions to recognize depression. It is also reflected in the fact that the model comprised of time- and frequency-domain features has the same performance as the model consisted of all features. Second, different classifiers display varying performance when given the same feature vector as input.




(2) For deep learning-based gait depression recognition methods, the multi-modal models are more accurate than the single-modal models~\cite{shao2021multi}. Researchers found that the skeleton can help to locate the spatial position of joints of the human body, and the silhouette can describe the detailed information of the human body shape so that the constructed 3D model is more vivid.
Shao obtained better classification performance using skeleton and silhouette fusion, which agrees that the skeleton and silhouette information are related and complementary.
%Compared with silhouette data, skeleton data can describe dynamic changes during walking more accurately.






%It agrees that there is complementary information between the skeleton and the silhouette modality and also verifies that the experimental results of this paper are valid.


(3)
The gait depression recognition method based on deep learning outperforms traditional machine learning for the same dataset~\cite{9187648,fang2019depression,yang2022data}.
In previous studies, scholars have been committed to exploring new gait features and using traditional machine learning models for classification, and the accuracy has been continuously improved. However, traditional machine learning technologies were limited in their ability to process natural data in their raw form, and lack the ability to express complex functions, making it difficult to solve more complex natural signal processing problems. Deep learning allows computational models that are composed of multiple processing layers to learn representations of data with multiple levels of abstraction, and demonstrate a powerful ability to learn the
essential characteristics of a data set from a small number of samples.

%Although the hand-crafted method increases the processing procedure, it is conducive to enhancing interpretability.
